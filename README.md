## âœ… Project Development Checklist

This checklist guides our phased development, breaking down the project into manageable sprints. As this is a single-developer project, consider these as personal milestones.

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Structure (Sprint 1)

This phase establishes the foundational application structure and development environment.

- [X] **1.1 Project Initialization:**
  - [X] Initialize React TanStack Start project.
    - _Considerations:_ Choose an appropriate template if available.
    - _Tools:_ `npm create tanstack-start@latest` or similar.
  - [X] Set up Git repository and initial commit.
    - _Best Practice:_ Establish clear commit message conventions.
    - _Tools:_ Git, GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket.
  - [X] Configure basic project structure (folders for components, pages, hooks, utilities).
- [X] **1.2 Routing & Navigation:**
  - [X] Implement basic routing for different algorithm categories (e.g., `/sorting`, `/searching`, `/pathfinding`).
    - _Considerations:_ Utilize TanStack Router for type-safe routing.
  - [X] Create a home page/dashboard with clear links to various algorithm visualizers.
- [ ] **1.3 Core Layout & UI Shell:**
  - [ ] Develop a basic application layout (header, sidebar/navigation, main content area).
  - [ ] Design a simple, responsive UI shell to house the visualizations.
- [ ] **1.4 Initial Data Generation (SSR Integration):**
  - [ ] Experiment with `createServerFn` in React TanStack Start to generate an initial, simple dataset (e.g., a small array) on the server.
    - _Considerations:_ This demonstrates server-side rendering benefits for initial load.
    - _Purpose:_ Validate SSR data fetching.

### Phase 2: Algorithm Integration & Basic Visualization (Sprint 2-3)

This phase focuses on implementing the first set of algorithms and their fundamental visual representations.

- [ ] **2.1 Data Input Component:**
  - [ ] Create a generic component for user input (e.g., array size, maze dimensions, number range).
  - [ ] Implement validation for user inputs.
- [ ] **2.2 Algorithm Selection & Configuration:**
  - [ ] Develop a component to select which algorithm to visualize.
  - [ ] Allow for algorithm-specific configurations (e.g., sorting order, pathfinding start/end points).
- [ ] **2.3 Sorting Algorithm - First Pass (e.g., Bubble Sort):**
  - [ ] Implement the core logic for Bubble Sort.
  - [ ] **State Management:** Design the state structure to hold:
    - [ ] The current array/data set.
    - [ ] The array of `visualizationSteps` (an array of objects, each representing a distinct state of the data to be rendered, e.g., `{ array: [5, 2, 8], highlightedIndices: [0, 1], type: 'compare' }`).
    - [ ] `currentStepIndex` to track the playback position.
  - [ ] Create a custom hook (`useBubbleSortVisualizer`) to encapsulate the algorithm logic and state transitions.
- [ ] **2.4 Basic Visualization (HTML Canvas or D3.js setup):**
  - [ ] Choose between HTML Canvas and D3.js.
    - _Considerations (Canvas):_ Higher performance for large datasets, direct pixel manipulation.
    - _Considerations (D3.js):_ More declarative, great for SVG-based visualizations, rich ecosystem.
  - [ ] Set up the chosen visualization library to render the initial state of the data (e.g., bars for an array, grid for a maze).
  - [ ] Implement basic updates based on `visualizationSteps` (e.g., changing bar colors for comparisons/swaps).
- [ ] **2.5 Playback Controls:**
  - [ ] Implement "Play", "Pause", "Next Step", "Previous Step", and "Reset" buttons.
  - [ ] Control the `currentStepIndex` to navigate through the `visualizationSteps`.
  - [ ] Implement an animation loop for "Play" mode.

### Phase 3: Advanced Algorithms & Performance Optimization (Sprint 4-5)

This phase expands the algorithm library and addresses performance for larger datasets.

- [ ] **3.1 Implement Additional Algorithms:**
  - [ ] **Sorting:** Merge Sort, Quick Sort (or another chosen sort).
    - _Considerations:_ Merge Sort will require managing sub-arrays and their merging process visually.
  - [ ] **Searching:** Binary Search (for sorted arrays).
    - _Considerations:_ Highlight the search range and comparison points.
  - [ ] **Pathfinding:** Dijkstra's Algorithm or A\*.
    - _Considerations:_ Grid-based representation, highlighting visited nodes, path, and shortest distance. This will likely involve a more complex `visualizationSteps` structure to represent grid changes.
- [ ] **3.2 Web Workers Integration:**
  - [ ] Refactor algorithm computations (especially for larger datasets or complex pathfinding) to run in a Web Worker.
    - _Considerations:_ Utilize transferable objects for efficient data passing between the main thread and the worker.
    - _Benefit:_ Prevents UI freezing during heavy computations.
  - [ ] Design the communication protocol between the main thread and the Web Worker (e.g., sending input data to worker, worker sending `visualizationSteps` back).
- [ ] **3.3 Advanced Visualization Techniques:**
  - [ ] Optimize rendering for larger datasets (e.g., efficient Canvas drawing techniques, D3.js transitions).
  - [ ] Implement smoother animations and transitions between algorithm steps.
  - [ ] Add visual cues for different algorithm states (e.g., different colors for 'current element', 'swapped', 'sorted', 'visited node', 'path').
- [ ] **3.4 Performance Benchmarking:**
  - [ ] Conduct basic performance tests with varying data sizes.
  - [ ] Identify bottlenecks and optimize rendering or algorithm logic.

## ðŸ“… Agile Workflow (Self-Managed)

As a single developer, "agile" here means being flexible and iterative. I'll be adopting:

- **Sprints:** Aiming for 1-2 week cycles to focus efforts and achieve tangible progress.
- **Daily Check-ins:** A quick mental review each morning on yesterday's progress and today's goals.
- **Sprint Planning:** At the start of each "sprint," define clear objectives and tasks from the checklist.
- **Sprint Review:** At the end of each "sprint," review completed tasks and visualize progress.
- **Retrospective:** Periodically reflect on what went well and what could be improved in the personal workflow.
- **Task Tracking:** Utilizing a simple personal Kanban board (digital or physical) to visualize task flow.
